# Embedded-Systems-Optimization-s-
A Final Project for a class that was about optimization. Project was done with three members total: Brian Pease, Kyle Anderson, Lorenzo Gardea.

Most of the work was a collaborative effort to make a grayscale and sobel algorithm run optimally on a raspberry pi 3. This particular solution has some issues with larger sized videos due to some unknown issues.

The Buffer class was entierly designed and implemented by Me, to hopefully have threads constantly working on data and avoid waiting. The current issues with this project is most likely due to the buffer class but additinal time has not been put into this project.
